# About me

## :book: History 

:call_me_hand: Hey, my name is Yurii. I am (or was?) qualified engineer with honors dedgree. I thought that I would have a really bright future as an engineer but once i watched a video where a guy told how to create an own website. And i was really interesting and excited about this. So the next day i downloaded and installed the first IDE (Brackets) and created my first ever index.html with a "Hello World!" phrase. This is how it started!

## :watch: Today

:mortar_board: Nowadays, i'm improving my skills in HTML, CSS, JS and preparing myself to learn React. If you would like to see my skills, check my latest/last updated repository out.

:man_technologist: My current skills:
- ***HTML5 + CSS3***;
- ***jQuery/JS***;
- ***Figma/Avocode/Photoshop***;
- ***Gulp/Webpack5***;
- ***Git/Github***.

:computer: Working on [__dreammaker__](https://github.com/mrdeviantart/dreammaker)...


## :warning: Warning!!!

The [__"projects"__](https://github.com/mrdeviantart/projects) repository contains my very first three projects where i started learning __HTML/CSS/gulp/jQuery/JS__ and made a lot of mistakes. So do not take into acoount! I just did not want to delete it.
