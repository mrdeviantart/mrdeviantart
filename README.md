# About me

## :book: History 

:call_me_hand: Hey, my name is Yurii. I am (or was?) qualified engineer with honors dedgree. I thought that I would have a really bright future as an engineer but once i watched a video where a guy told how to create an own website. And i was really interesting and excited about this. So the next day i downloaded and installed the first IDE (Brackets) and created my first ever index.html with a "Hello World!" phrase. This is how it started!

## :watch: Today

:mortar_board: Nowadays, i'm improving my skills in HTML, CSS, JS and preparing myself to learn React. If you would like to see my skills, check my latest/last updated repository out.

:man_technologist: My current stack:

- ***HTML5 + CSS3***;
- ***JS/TS***;
- ***Figma/Avocode/Photoshop***;
- ***Gulp/Webpack5***;
