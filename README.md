#Gettting started

- 👋 Hey, my name is Yurii. I am (or was?) qualified engineer with honors dedgree. I thought that I would have a really bright future as an engineer but once i watched video where a guy told how to create an own website. And i was really interesting and excited about this. So the next day i downloaded and installed the first IDE (Brackets) and created my first ever index.html with a "Hello World!" phrase. This is how it started!
