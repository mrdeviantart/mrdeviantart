Hey, my name is Yurii. I am (or was?) qualified engineer with honors dedgree. I thought that I would have a really bright future as an engineer but once i watched a video where a guy told how to create an own website. And i was really interesting and excited about this. So the next day i downloaded and installed the first IDE (Brackets) and created my first ever index.html with a "Hello World!" phrase. This is how it started!

Nowadays, i'm improving my skills in HTML, CSS, JS and preparing myself to learn React. If you would like to see my skills, checkout my latest repository.

WARNING!!! The "projects" repository contains my very first three projects where i started learning HTML/CSS/gulp/jQuery/JS and made a lot of mistakes. So do not take into acoount! I just did not want to delete it.

Thank you for your attention! Have a good day!
