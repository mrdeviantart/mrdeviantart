# About me

## :book: History 

:call_me_hand: Hey, my name is Yurii. I am (or was?) qualified engineer with honors dedgree. I thought that I would have a really bright future as an engineer but once i watched a video where a guy told how to create an own website. And i was really interesting and excited about this. So the next day i downloaded and installed the first IDE (Brackets) and created my first ever index.html with a "Hello World!" phrase. This is how it started!

## :mortar_board: Today

Nowadays, i'm improving my skills in HTML, CSS, JS and preparing myself to learn React. If you would like to see my skills, check my latest/last updated repository out.

## :warning: Warning!!!

The [__"projects"__](./projects) repository contains my very first three projects where i started learning HTML/CSS/gulp/jQuery/JS and made a lot of mistakes. So do not take into acoount! I just did not want to delete it.

Thank you for your attention! Have a good day!
